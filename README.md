GuessingGame
============

First Java Application

Basic Guessing Game with a twist. You have to guess the number of times the ball will hit a window before breaking! Made this to find my prowess at coding in Java. Learned a lot about simple algorithms, JFrame,JPanel, Swing Components and memory consumption.
